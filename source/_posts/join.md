Why should you join
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy to see that you are as interested in robots as we are. To start out let's talk about a few things, namely that you don't need any experience, the club is free, and it is a lot of fun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our members joined the club with little knowledge of programming or working with metal. The only thing they needed to know is that they wanted to build a robot. The club is set up in such a way that you do not need any prior experience to start out, you only need to come to the build meetings There you will jump around a bit from task to task until you find what you really want to do. Then you will be mentored by other members so that you can start helping build the robot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to see how fun the competitions are before the season starts then you should come to Battle at the Border. This is an off season event that is hosted at the Francis Parker School. The event is like a competition but is smaller and a good place to gain exposer to what a real competition is like.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a team we try to do more than just build robots. One of the other things we do is spread awareness of our club to younger students. In the past we have gone to Muirlands middle school as well as Torrey Pines and La Jolla elementary school.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we went to Muirlands we were trying to get graduating 8th graders a chance to see something they can participate in when they go to high school. In the elementary schools we focused on spreading awareness of our robotics club so students can start getting excited at a young age. During our trips to a school we show off the robot we created, as well as pictures of machines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trips are an attempt to keep young minds interested in robotics or get possible robotics members the extra push they might need to see how fun and great robotics is. However no matter which school we go to, our main goal remains clear to create enthusiasm for learning how to build a robot as well as the technology field.

On Campus
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The club does a lot on campus. Our school has only one two-semester course relating to engineering, which is a mechanical physics course. So we help fill in that gap and allow for the students at our school to learn about engineering and electronics. The computer science teacher at La Jolla High retired and the administration wanted to stop offering the computer science classes. Our club stepped in to try and convince the administration that computer science was worth keeping at La Jolla High school and we managed to save our computer science courses.

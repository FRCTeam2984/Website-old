 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this year's game was to attack the enemy castle. To do this our robot had to cross defenses and shoot balls into either a low or a high goal. Each of these actions gave a different amount of points that would be added to your score. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each game round was 2 minutes and 30 seconds long with a 15 second autonomous period at the beginning of the round. During this autonomous period the driver and operator of the robot could not control it in any way. After the 15 seconds are over they can control the robots functions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year we participate in the First Robotics Competition, in which teams have 6 weeks to design and build a robot that competes in a sport-like event. At the end of the build season we attend regional competitions with teams from around the world in Las Vegas and San Diego. At the 2016 Las Vegas Regional we competed with teams from Mexico, China, Denmark, Germany and Brazil.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first weeks of the build season we hold meetings to discuss the new competition and design of our robot. Construction of the chassis begins around the second week of the build season to give our drive team as much time as possible to practice. Electronics, coding and fine tuning happen in the final weeks of the build season. At the six week mark the robot is bagged and tagged and may not be unwrapped until at a regional competition. Work on additional parts (like the arm) continues after the build season, and the parts are added on at the competition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We work on fundraising and recruiting new members year round! Our team hosts a table at Club Day and Welcome to LJHS events. We also visit local our local elementary and middle schools to provide information and foster and interest in engineering in younger students.

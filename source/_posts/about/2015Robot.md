![The 2015 Robot](/first/images/2015Robot/DSC00235.JPG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robo<span class="overline">bo</span> was our team's robot for the 2015 season. Its main purpose was to stack totes (boxes) which it did using an elevator mechanism. The elevators on the sides of the lifting cage would move up and down to pick up a tote. Every time they were up we would drive up to another tote and have it slide under the previous tote(s). Then we would lower the elevators and the hooks would release the lifted tote and grab on to the bottom tote. We could then repeat this process as many times as we wanted. The lifters included encoders so that the software could move them to the appropriate positions upon the direction of the operator.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cool feature of our robot were the transmission. We made them ourselves which allowed us to incorporate the flexibility we needed into the design itself. Instead of being fixed in one position we were able to configure them into a multitude of positions. We could pivot the motor position around the belt portion, then the whole assembly could be rotated around the axle that it is attached to.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was of great use to use because we had a very limited amount of space on our robot. In the front we needed to keep everything as close to the x-axis as possible. To do this we rotated the transmissions so that the motor was just above the axle but was displaced towards the back of the robot.

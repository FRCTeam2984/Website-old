Who are we?
-------

![The 2015 season team.][TeamPhoto]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small, student run team from La Jolla High school. Our team usually has around 12 full time members, and as many as 20 part time members.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people believe you have to have experience building or programming to join our club. That couldn’t be further from the truth! Most of our members have little prior knowledge when they join our team; the skills that people learn through FIRST Robotics can’t be easily taught in a classroom or learned at home. Because our robot is built entirely from the ground up we machine our own parts, do our own wiring, and write our own code. Any student that is curious about or interested in engineering is encouraged to join and learn these valuable skills as the year goes on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most team members continue to use what they have learned  into college, going on to pursue STEM degrees at engineering focused colleges such as Cal Tech, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Cal Poly SLO.

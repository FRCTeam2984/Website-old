Crimping Small
===
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimping small connectors is similar to crimping large connectors, however there are some key differences. Instead of striping enough wire to fit into the contact completely we only have to strip the wire up enough for fit in the second set of clips.

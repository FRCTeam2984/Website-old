SolidWorks
===

## Introduction

This course is based on the [25-part video series produced by SolidWorks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogKYHcprYlU&list=PLiKqXuECiKNJaUpNv3ZW-gEKDxfWgShwG).

- SolidWorks is an industry-leading 3D design tool.
- 3.5 million engineers use it.
- Save time and money by building virtual prototypes.

- Three document types: Part; Assembly; and Drawing
- Build a simple part.
- Sketches and features within a Part can be viewed and selected in "feature manager" on left panel.
- Press the spacebar to select views.
- Right-click a toolbar to customize it.
- Be sure to check out the tutorials under "Help."
- A drafting standard is a collection of document presets. Choose one (usually ANSII or ISO) from the Properties menu.

## Parts

- Build a C-frame.
- Every part begins as a 2D sketch.
- A sketch must be drawn onto a plane or surface. If you're having trouble drawing, be sure that you've selected the plane into which you plan to draw.
- To deselect the line tool, either right-click/select, or press the escape key.
- Every element in a sketch must be fully defined, meaning it must have a specific location and can't move.
- Under-defined entities are shown in blue, and have a (-) to the left in the feature manager.
- Use relations and dimensions to fully specify the entities in a sketch. There are many to choose from.
- The offset entities tool duplicates sketch entities at an offset, which can be useful for C-frames and many other parts.
- Extrusions are available from the features tab.
- Mid-plane extrusions give Parts symmetry, which can be very helpful when parts are combined into Assemblies.
- The underlying sketch of an extrusion can be edited. Saving the sketch updates the extrusion.
- Control-Z to undo.
- Use the fillet tool to create rounded edges.

- Start a bracket.
- Zoom in/out with scoll wheel or Z/Shift-Z.
- Fit the model on the screen by pressing "F".
- Arrows rotate model in increments of 15 degrees.
- Control+arrow pans model.
- Shift+arrow rotates model 90&deg;.
- Alt+arrow free rotates model.
- View/Display/Tangent Edges will show and hide lines appearing between flat and curved surfaces.

- Finish the bracket.
- The Hole Wizard creates holes for standard fasteners. Use the Hole Wizard especially when a hole will be filled with a fastener.
- Adding holes is a two-part process:
  1. choose the hole type
  2. place the holes
- After creation, holes can be precisely positioned by constraining their center points with dimensions and relations.
- Begin a sketch on a surface by right-clicking and clicking the Sketch icon.
- Automatic guide lines help you place tangent lines. However, this sometimes fails to create a relation. If so, you must add it yourself.
- Use Extruded Cut to remove material from a model. Multiple surfaces can be selected for cutaway by clicking them.

- Build a compression spring.
- Helix/Spiral is a kind of 3D feature similar to Extruded Boss/Base. Like other features, it operates on a sketch through the third dimension.
- Avoid re-drawing entities by copying them from one plane to another with Convert Entities.
- Add a new plane through Reference Geometry.
- Combine curves with Composite Curve.
- A Pierce Relation can be used to align a circle centerpoint with an out-of-plane curve.
- Swept Boss/Base extrudes along a curve.

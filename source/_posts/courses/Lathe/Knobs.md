Look at all these knobs
===

There are quite a few ways to move the lathe, in this lesson I will outline them.
To start out here is a diagram of all the knobs on the carriage.

1. **Carriage handwheel**, used for moving the carriage large distances along the lathe's length.
2. **Cross feed handwheel**, used for moving the tool in and out perpendicularly to the Carriage handwheel's motion.
3. **Half-nut Lever**, used for engaging the auto feeder.
4. **Carriage lock screw**, used for locking the carriage's position along the lathe's length.
5. **Tool post slide handwheel**, used for fine movements along the length of the lathe while taking off material.
6. **Tool post**, holds the tool which is shown by letter H.
7. **Locking Lever**, locks the tool in place so it can not move.
8. **Tool**, an attachment that can be swapped out for a different use.
9. **Compound Rest**, the assembly that slides around on top of the carriage.
10. **Carriage**, the base assembly of the lathe which only moves along the lathe's length.

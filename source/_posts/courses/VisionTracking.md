Vision Tracking
===
Vision tracking is widely regarded as a difficult problem, however given the right mindset it can become remarkably easy. This course will cover the basics of vision acquisition and processing. Then it will go into using the data acquired by the camera to align a robot with a vision target. At the conclusion of the basic section it will go into detail about implementing the algorithms in Java.

The second section of the course will go into more advanced vision topics and how to more greatly fine tune the vision tracker to improve results. For most applications the first section should be more than enough.
